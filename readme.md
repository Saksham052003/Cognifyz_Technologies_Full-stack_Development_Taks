## Full-stack Development Taks

### Task 1: HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction
Objective: Introduce the concept of server-side rendering and basic form submissions.
  Steps:
1. Create an HTML structure with forms for user input.
2. Set up a simple Node.js server using Express.
3.Create server-side endpoints to handle form submissions.
4. Use server-side rendering (e.g., EJS) to dynamically generate HTML.


### Task 2: Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation
 Objective: Expand inline styles and introduce server side validation for form submissions.
 Steps:
1. Extend HTML with more complex forms and user interactions.
2. Utilize inline JavaScript for client-side form validation.
3. Implement server-side validation for submitted form data.
4. Store validated data in temporary server-side storage.

### Task 3: Advanced CSS Styling and Responsive Design
 Objective: Enhance CSS styling and make the webpage fully responsive.
 Steps:
 1. Create a more complex layout with multiple sections.
 2. Experiment with CSS properties for advanced styling (e.g., transitions, animations).
 3. Utilize a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for a consistent and responsive UI.
   
### Task 4: Complex Form Validation and Dynamic DOM Manipulation
 Objective: Extend form validation and implement dynamic updates to the DOM.
 Steps:
 1.    Enhance form validation to include more complex rules (e.g., password strength).
 2.    Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions using JavaScript.
 3.    Implement client-side routing for a smoother user experience.

### Task 5: API Integration and Front-End Interaction
 Objective: Introduce server-client communication through a RESTful API.
 Steps:
1. Create RESTful API endpoints on the server for handling CRUD operations.
 2.    Develop a front-end interface that interacts with your own server API.
 3.    Fetch and display data from your API on the front end.

### Task 6: Database Integration and User Authentication
 Objective: Integrate a database and implement user authentication for secure data handling.
 Steps:
 1.   Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB,MySQL) for storing and retrieving form data.
 2.   Implement user authentication on the server.
 3.   Secure your API endpoints by adding authorization checks.

### Task 7: Advanced API Usage and External API Integration
 Objective: Explore advanced API concepts and integrate external APIs.
 Steps:
 1. Investigate concepts like OAuth for secure API authentication.
 2. Integrate an external API (e.g., third-party services) into your application.
 3. Implement advanced API features such as rate limiting and error handling.

### Task 8 Advanced Server-Side Functionality
 Objective: Implement advanced server-side features for a robust application.
 Steps:
 1.   Introduce middleware for request processing (e.g., body parsing, logging).
 2.   Implement background tasks or job processing using tools like Redis or a task queue.
 3.   Explore server-side caching mechanisms for optimized performance.
